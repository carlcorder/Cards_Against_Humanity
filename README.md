# Cards Against Humanity Simulator
Simulate playing the game Cards Against Humanity & generate a relative frequency histogram of the number of rounds played
before a winner is declared. My underlying assumptions are that each round a serf (a player who is not the card Czar) is
chosen randomly from a uniform distribution and elects as the new card Czar.

The histogram is generated by replaying the game one million times. The default values are 13 players with 5 points needed
to win.
