# Cards Against Humanity Simulator
You are playing Cards Against Humanity with your friends. Some people already have 3 cards, but it starting to get late.
In the back of your mind you are wondering how long it will take until a winner is declared. Should you try to finish the
game, or should you call it a night? Enter the Cards Against Humanity Simulator.

This program simulates playing the game Cards Against Humanity & generates a relative frequency histogram of the number of
rounds played before a winner is declared. My underlying assumptions are that each round a serf (a player who is not the card Czar)
is chosen randomly from a uniform distribution and elected as the new card Czar.

The histogram is generated by replaying the game 100,00. The default values are 8 players with 5 points needed
to win.

The probability density function is very similar to the [`uniform sum distribution`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irwin-Hall_distribution) with the exception that each round a
random player is removed from the selection process.
