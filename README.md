# Cards Against Humanity Simulator
Simulate playing the game Cards Against Humanity & generate a relative frequency histogram of the number of rounds played
before a winner is declared. My underlying assumptions are that each round a serf (a player who is not the card Czar) is
chosen randomly from a uniform distribution and elected as the new card Czar.

The histogram is generated by replaying the game one million times. The default values are 13 players with 5 points needed
to win.

The probability density function is very similar to the [`uniform sum distribution`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irwin-Hall_distribution) with the exception that each round a
random player is removed from the selection process.
